THE GAMES MOTIVE IS TO INDULGE THE PLAYERS IN PUTTING CROSSES AND CIRCLES ON THE CORRESPONDING BOX SUCH THAT:-
1) WHOSOEVER COMPLETES THE PATTERN OF SAME SYMBOL IN VERTICAL/HORIZONTAL/DIAGONALLY WINS THE GAME.
2) AS 2 PLAYER GAME SO THE GAME MUST DRAW IF THE PATTERN DOESN'T FORM.
3) THE MAZE WILL NOT TAKE INPUTS WHEN THE GAME IS OVER.
4) INVALID CHOICES OF BOXES WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.
5) IN ONE ROUND ONCE THE BOX IS filled with pattern IT CANNOT BE CHANGED IN THE SAME ROUND.
6) YOU COULD WAIT FOR YOUR OPPONENT TO MAKE MISTAKES AND MAKE YOUR MOVE THEREBY.
